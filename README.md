# Volpe Language Server

A simple language server for the Volpe programming language.

## Usage

Set the `"volpe-ls.serverPath"` configuration setting to the full path of the Volpe Language Server executable.

To make use of semantic highlighting, make sure you either use a colour theme that supports it, or enable it manually by adding `"editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled": true` to your `settings.json`.
